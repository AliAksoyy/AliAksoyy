## My process

### Built with
- JS DOM
- JS Functions
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I learned how to use Javascript DOM Manipulation, flexboxes, media queries, html elements and many more.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media only screen and (min-width: 790px) {
}
```
```js
        if(e.which ==13 || e.keyCode == 13) {
            localStorage.setItem("names", e.target.innerText);
            names.blur();
        }else {
            localStorage.setItem("names", e.target.innerText);
        }
}
```


### Continued development

I will build backend and extra pages for this website in the future.

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schoold](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for basics of website paradigm. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is an amazing document which helped me finally understand deep sides of web development. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning these concepts.
